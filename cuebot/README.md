# Cuebot

Cuebot typically runs on a server and performs a variety of important OpenCue management
tasks, including:

- Managing OpenCue jobs and job submissions.
- Distributing work to render nodes.
- Responding to API requests from client-side tools such as CueGUI.

A typical OpenCue deployment runs a single instance of Cuebot, which is shared by all users.
