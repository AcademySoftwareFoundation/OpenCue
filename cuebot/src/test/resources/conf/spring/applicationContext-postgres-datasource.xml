    The way the unit tests work right now, any test that has this XML included will set up the entire context from scratch for the
    individual test. The TestDatabaseSetup works around this problem by creating only 1 database per process, no matter how many times the
    bean is created. The username and password will be the same for the entire process.

    What about using a test suite? That idea didn't pan out because I wasn't able to get spring to initialize the test suite class / inject
    information (db username/password/etc..) back in to the spring context for use by the individual test classes.

    Unlike the Oracle version of this bean, a destroy hook isn't needed; the embedded database exits and is torn down when
    the process exits.
