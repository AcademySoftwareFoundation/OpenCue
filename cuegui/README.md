# CueGUI

CueGUI is the graphical user interface for OpenCue, divided into two main workspace views. 

- **Cuetopia** is the artist-focused view for monitoring and managing render jobs, including plugins such as Monitor Jobs, Monitor Job Details, Frame logs, and Job Graph. 

- **CueCommander** is the administrator-focused view for system monitoring and host management, providing advanced tools for allocations, hosts, services, and system resources. Together, they empower artists, production staff, and administrators to track job progress, troubleshoot issues, and manage render farm operations.
