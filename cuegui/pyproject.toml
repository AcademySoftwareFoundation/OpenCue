description = "CueGUI is the graphical user interface for OpenCue with two main workspace views. Cuetopia provides artist-focused tools for monitoring and managing render jobs through plugins like Monitor Jobs, Job Details, Frame logs, and Job Graph. CueCommander offers administrator-focused system monitoring and host management with advanced tools for allocations, hosts, services, and resources. Together, they enable artists and administrators to track job progress and manage render farm operations."
