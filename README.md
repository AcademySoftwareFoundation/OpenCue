## Introduction

OpenCue is an open source render management system. You can use OpenCue in
visual effects and animation production to break down complex jobs into
individual tasks. You can submit jobs to a configurable dispatch queue that
allocates the necessary computational resources.

## OpenCue features

OpenCue provides features to manage rendering management at scale:

- Sony Imageworks in-house render manager used on hundreds of films.
- Highly-scalable architecture supporting numerous concurrent machines.
- Tagging systems allow you to allocate specific jobs to specific machine
  types.
- Jobs are process on a central render farm and don't rely on the artist's
  workstation.
- Native multi-threading that supports Katana, Prman, and Arnold.
- Support for multi facility, on-premisses, cloud, and hybrid deployments.
- You can split a host into a large number of procs, each with their own
  reserved core and memory requirements.
- Integrated automated booking.
- No limit on the number of procs a job can have.
