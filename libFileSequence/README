libFileSequence requries the following dependencies:
- boost any (header only)
- libpcre

The Java and Python bindings need swig and the languange development libraries installed and expect libFileSequence.so to be in your library path already.

The unit tests require cppunit to be installed and expect libFileSequence.so to be in your library path.

seqexpand and seqls are two sample c++ programs that require libFileSequence.so to be in your library path.
