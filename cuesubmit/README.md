# CueSubmit

CueSubmit is a submission tool for OpenCue that allows artists and developers to easily submit jobs to the render farm. It provides an interface to configure job parameters, layers, and dependencies before dispatching work.

This is a Python-based QT app through which you can submit jobs to an OpenCue deployment. It can run as a standalone application, or as a plugin in applications that support PySide/qtpy integration, such as Autodesk's Maya or the Foundry's Nuke.
