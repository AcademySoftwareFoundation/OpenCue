  Build custom RQD container images to deploy as OpenCue rendering hosts
---

This guide describes how to customize the default [RQD container image published
on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/opencue/rqd). The default RQD container
image doesn't include any rendering software. This guide explains how to create
a custom Dockerfile that builds on the basic `opencue/rqd` image to install
rendering software. You can adapt the basic ideas in this guide for many other types of
software, including commercial rendering packages, such as Maya.

## Before you begin

This guide follows on from the OpenCue
[quick starts for macOS and Linux](/docs/quick-starts/). Before you work
through the steps in this guide, make sure you have successfully started the
OpenCue sandbox environment and run a basic command-line test job. You'll
also need all of the software and source code you used in the quick start.

## Sample Dockerfiles

The OpenCue project includes [sample](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/tree/master/samples/rqd/) `Dockerfiles` to illustrate how to install
additional software for RQD containers. 
OpenCue currently includes sample Dockerfiles showcasing the following:

- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) installation
- [Nvidia CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) installation for GPU accelerated rendering

To view the sample `Dockerfiles`:

1.  Open a terminal.

1.  Change to the directory you cloned or downloaded the OpenCue
    repository to. For example, if the `OpenCue` directory is in
    in your home directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    cd ~/OpenCue
    ```
1. Change to the subdirectory which includes the sample `Dockerfiles`.

    ```bash
    cd samples/rqd
    ```

The sample `Dockerfiles` are listed within their respective subdirectories.

### Reviewing the sample Blender Dockerfile

The sample Blender `Dockerfile` showcases the Blender installation process and environment variable setup.
You can update the sandbox environment to build and run the sample `Dockerfile` so that you can submit and run a rendering job using Blender than just the basic command-line tools illustrated in the quick start. 

Before you update the sandbox to run the sample `Dockerfile`, you might find it useful to review the source code for the sample container.

Run the following command to review the sample `Dockerfile`:

```bash
cat blender/Dockerfile
```
The command outputs the contents of the Dockerfile.

The first section of the file indicates that this `Dockerfile`
builds on the basic `opencue/rqd` container image hosted on
Docker Hub:

```Dockerfile
# Builds on the latest base image of RQD from Docker Hub
FROM opencue/rqd
```

The next section installs all of the dependencies required
to run Blender 2.79 on the CentOS operating system installed in the
`opencue/rqd` container image:

```Dockerfile
# Install dependencies to run Blender on the opencue/rqd image
RUN yum -y update
RUN yum -y install \
        bzip2 \
        libfreetype6 \
        libgl1-mesa-dev \
        libXi-devel  \
        mesa-libGLU-devel \
        zlib-devel \
        libXinerama-devel \
        libXrandr-devel
```

The next section sets up parameters for the Blender installation directory and download source.

```Dockerfile
# Set Blender install directory
ARG BLENDER_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/blender

# Set Blender download source
ARG BLENDER_DOWNLOAD_SRC=https://download.blender.org/release/Blender3.3/blender-3.3.3-linux-x64.tar.xz
```

The final section downloads and extracts the archive for Blender
to the provided installation directory, in this case `/usr/local/blender`.:

```Dockerfile
# Download and install Blender
RUN mkdir ${BLENDER_INSTALL_DIR}
RUN curl -SL ${BLENDER_DOWNLOAD_SRC} \
        -o blender.tar.xz

RUN tar -xvf blender.tar.xz \
        -C ${BLENDER_INSTALL_DIR} \
        --strip-components=1

RUN rm blender.tar.xz
```

The final command verifies the Blender installation.

```Dockerfile
# Verify Blender installation
RUN ${BLENDER_INSTALL_DIR}/blender --version
```

If you'd like to learn more about the configuration of the default
`opencue/rqd` container image, view the source code for
[`rqd/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/blob/master/rqd/Dockerfile)
in the `master` branch on GitHub.

### Reviewing the sample CUDA Dockerfile

The sample CUDA Dockerfile extends the default RQD container image to support GPU rendering on supported Nvidia Hardware. This requires Nvidia [Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#installing-with-apt) to be installed on render nodes as a prerequisite.

Run the following command to review the sample `Dockerfile`:

```bash
cat cuda/Dockerfile
```
The command outputs the contents of the Dockerfile.


## Updating the sandbox environment

To build and run the sample `Dockerfile` in the sandbox environment, you need
to update the `docker-compose.yml` file that defines the deployment. For a
production system, you might make a similar change to update the configuration
files for a container management platform, such as Kubernetes.

Complete the following steps to configure the sandbox environment to build and
run the sample `Dockerfile`:

1.  Open the `sandbox/docker-compose.yml` file in your preferred text
    editor.

1.  Find the following lines:

    ```yaml
      rqd:
        image: opencue/rqd
    ```

1.  Replace the lines from the previous step with the following code:

    ```yaml
      rqd:
        build:
          context: ./
          dockerfile: ./samples/rqd/blender/blender2.79-docker/Dockerfile
    ```

    This change configures Docker Compose to build your local copy of the 
    Dockerfile in the `samples` directory instead of using the
    `opencue/rqd` image on Docker Hub.

1.  Save your changes.

1.  Before you start Docker Compose, delete any existing OpenCue sandbox
    environment containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose --project-directory . -f sandbox/docker-compose.yml rm
    ```

1.  To re-deploy the sandbox environment, run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose --project-directory . -f sandbox/docker-compose.yml up
    ```

## Submitting a rendering job

To run a sample rendering job, you'll need a sample `.blend` Blender file. If
you don't have an existing `.blend` file, the Blender project publishes a
variety of  [demo resources](https://www.blender.org/download/demo-files/).

{{% alert title="Note" color="info"%}}Make sure you download a demo file that
works with version 2.79 of Blender or earlier.{{% /alert %}}

After you download a suitable `.blend` Blender file, move it to the
`/tmp/rqd/shots` directory. The sandbox environment is configured so that both
your host machine and the RQD container can access the `/tmp/rqd/shots`
directory.

If you're starting CueSubmit and CueGUI in the OpenCue sandbox, you need
to set the values of the following environment variables in the Python
`venv` environment you created in the quick start:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
export OL_CONFIG=pyoutline/etc/outline.cfg
export CUEBOT_HOSTS=localhost
```

If you want to submit a Blender job type in the sandbox environment, then
you must also update the CueSubmit configuration:

1.  Copy the example CueSubmit config file:

    ```bash
    cp cuesubmit/cuesubmit_config.example.yaml sandbox/cuesubmit_config.yaml
    ```

1.  Open `sandbox/cuesubmit_config.yaml` in your preferred text editor.

1.  Update the value of `BLENDER_RENDER_CMD` to match the installation
    location in the RQD container image:

    ```yaml
    BLENDER_RENDER_CMD : "/usr/local/blender/blender"
    ```

1.  Set the value of the following environment variable to
    update the location of your custom CueSubmit configuration
    file:

    ```bash
    export CUESUBMIT_CONFIG_FILE=sandbox/cuesubmit_config.yaml
    ```

1.  Run the following command to start CueSubmit:

    ```bash
    cuesubmit &
    ```

To test submitting a Blender job to OpenCue, see
[Submitting jobs](/docs/user-guides/submitting-jobs/).

After you submit a job to OpenCue, you can
[monitor progress in CueGUI](/docs/user-guides/monitoring-your-jobs/).

## Stopping and deleting the sandbox environment

To delete the resources you created in this guide, run the following commands
from a shell:

1.  To stop the sandbox environment, run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose --project-directory . -f sandbox/docker-compose.yml stop
    ```

1.  To free up storage space, delete the containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose --project-directory . -f sandbox/docker-compose.yml rm
    ```
