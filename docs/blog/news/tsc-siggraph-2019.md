The OpenCue Technical Steering Committee (TSC) will be meeting at SIGGRAPH 2019.

The TSC holds regular meetings to discuss project direction and vote on important issues.
This upcoming meeting at SIGGRAPH, like all of the TSC meetings, is open to the public.

## Agenda

The main goal of this TSC meeting will be to sync after Tuesday's
[Birds of a Feather session](/blog/2019/07/08/opencue-roadmap-at-siggraph/) to discuss what
we learned and how those discussions might impact the project roadmap.

An initial draft of the agenda is checked into the
[OpenCue repository](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/blob/master/tsc/meetings/2019-07-31.md).
Attendees are welcome to propose additional agenda items either via Pull Request to that
file or in person.
