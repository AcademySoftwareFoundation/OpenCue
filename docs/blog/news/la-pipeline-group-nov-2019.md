A few weeks ago members of the OpenCue team gave
[a presentation](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Animation-and-VFX-Pipeline-Developers-Meetup/events/266022492/)
to the
[LA Pipeline Developers Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Animation-and-VFX-Pipeline-Developers-Meetup/).

Ben Dines and Cottalango Leon from Sony Pictures Imageworks presented the history of OpenCue and
how they're using it in production at SPI.

Brian Cipriano and Greg Denton from Google talked about the process of open sourcing OpenCue,
demonstrated a few different deployment methods using Docker and Kubernetes, and walked through
some features of the OpenCue Outline system.

The event was livestreamed, and a recording published:
