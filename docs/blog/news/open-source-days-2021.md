Big thanks to everyone who joined us at the Academy Software Foundation's annual Open Source Days!

Brian Cipriano from Google gave a project update, shared some of our upcoming development goals, and
showed some of the integration with third-party monitoring services we've been working on.

Diego Tavares from Sony Picture Imageworks shared how SPI has been using OpenCue in production and
some of the tweaks they've made, and showed how SPI is using OpenCue's new Prometheus/Grafana
integration.

[Our slides from the talk are now posted online.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XSTts__F4DHmK_ivNRricxsd4dMflGid-J9xSxFZ2_k/edit?usp=sharing)

A recording of the session will be shared here once it's available.
