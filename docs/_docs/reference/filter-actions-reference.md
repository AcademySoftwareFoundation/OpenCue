# Filter Actions Reference

## Overview

Filter actions are automated operations that execute when jobs match specific filter criteria in OpenCue. They enable automatic job management, resource allocation, and workflow optimization based on job properties like name, show, user, or service.

Filters are configured in CueGUI through **Views/Plugins** > **Cuecommander** > **Filters** plugin, where you can create matchers (conditions) and actions (operations) that apply to incoming jobs.

## How Filters Work

When a job is submitted to OpenCue:

1. **Matchers** evaluate job properties (name, show, user, etc.)
2. If matchers match, associated **Actions** execute automatically
3. Actions modify job properties or layer configurations
4. Filters run in priority order (configurable)

## Filter Action Types

OpenCue supports the following action types for automating job management:

### Job Management Actions

#### MOVE_JOB_TO_GROUP

Automatically moves jobs to a specific group based on filter criteria.

**What are Groups?**

Groups in OpenCue are organizational folders for tracking and managing jobs. Groups allow you to:
- Organize jobs by department (lighting, FX, compositing, etc.)
- Separate jobs by priority (hero shots, regular work, tests)
- Track resource usage per department or project phase
- Apply group-level resource policies

**How to Create Groups:**

1. Open CueGUI
2. Go to **Window** > **Open Windows: CueCommander**
3. Select **Views/Plugins** > **OpenCuecommander** > **Monitor Cue**
4. In the Show/Root Group tree, right-click on a show name or existing group
5. Select **"Create Group..."** from the context menu
6. Enter the group name (e.g., "lighting-group", "fx-group", "priority-group")
7. Click **OK**

**Use Cases:**
- Organize jobs by department (lighting, compositing, etc.)
- Separate test jobs from production jobs
- Group jobs by priority or resource requirements
- Track resource utilization by team

**Value Type:** `GROUP_TYPE` - Target group name (group must exist before filter runs)

**Example:**
```
Matcher: Job name contains "lighting"
Action: MOVE_JOB_TO_GROUP → "lighting-group"
Result: All lighting jobs automatically move to the lighting-group folder

Note: Ensure "lighting-group" exists before enabling this filter.
      Create groups in CueCommander > Monitor Cue > Right-click show > Create Group.
```

---

#### PAUSE_JOB

Automatically pauses jobs when they match filter criteria.

**Use Cases:**
- Hold jobs pending approval
- Pause test jobs during production hours
- Queue jobs for later execution

**Value Type:** `BOOLEAN_TYPE` - True to pause

**Example:**
```
Matcher: Job name starts with "test_"
Action: PAUSE_JOB → true
Result: All test jobs start in paused state
```

---

#### STOP_PROCESSING

Stops the filter processing chain for the matched job. Useful when you want to prevent subsequent filters from executing.

**Use Cases:**
- Short-circuit filter evaluation for specific jobs
- Prevent conflicting actions from other filters
- Optimize filter performance by stopping early

**Value Type:** `NONE_TYPE` - No value required

**Example:**
```
Matcher: Job name is "critical-hero-shot"
Action: STOP_PROCESSING
Result: Job matches but no further filters evaluate
```

---

### Job Resource Actions

#### SET_JOB_MIN_CORES

Sets the minimum number of CPU cores required for the job.

**Use Cases:**
- Ensure lightweight jobs don't reserve excessive resources
- Set baseline core requirements per show or user

**Value Type:** `FLOAT_TYPE` - Minimum cores (e.g., 1.0, 2.0, 4.0)

**Example:**
```
Matcher: Show is "demo-project"
Action: SET_JOB_MIN_CORES → 2.0
Result: All demo-project jobs require minimum 2 cores
```

---

#### SET_JOB_MAX_CORES

Sets the maximum number of CPU cores the job can use.

**Use Cases:**
- Limit resource usage for background jobs
- Prevent single jobs from monopolizing the farm
- Enforce resource policies per department

**Value Type:** `FLOAT_TYPE` - Maximum cores (e.g., 10.0, 50.0, 100.0)

**Example:**
```
Matcher: User is "intern_user"
Action: SET_JOB_MAX_CORES → 10.0
Result: Intern users limited to 10 cores maximum
```

---

#### SET_JOB_PRIORITY

Sets the job priority value (higher values = higher priority).

**Use Cases:**
- Automatically prioritize hero shots
- Lower priority for test renders
- Set department-specific priorities

**Value Type:** `INTEGER_TYPE` - Priority value (typical range: 0-1000)

**Example:**
```
Matcher: Job name contains "hero"
Action: SET_JOB_PRIORITY → 900
Result: Hero shots get high priority (900)
```

## Creating Filters in CueGUI

### Step 1: Open the Filters Plugin

1. Launch CueGUI
2. Go to **Views/Plugins** > **Cuecommander**
3. Select the **Filters** plugin

### Step 2: Create a Filter

1. Click **Create Filter**
2. Set filter name (e.g., "High-Priority Hero Shots")
3. Set filter type:
   - **MATCH_ALL**: All matchers must match (AND logic)
   - **MATCH_ANY**: Any matcher can match (OR logic)
4. Set filter order (lower numbers run first)
5. Enable/disable the filter

### Step 3: Add Matchers

Matchers define conditions for when the filter applies:

**Available Match Subjects:**
- `JOB_NAME`: Match against job name
- `SHOW`: Match against show name
- `SHOT`: Match against shot name
- `USER`: Match against submitting user
- `SERVICE_NAME`: Match against service (renderer)
- `PRIORITY`: Match against job priority
- `FACILITY`: Match against facility code
- `LAYER_NAME`: Match against layer names

**Match Types:**
- `CONTAINS`: Subject contains the text
- `DOES_NOT_CONTAIN`: Subject doesn't contain the text
- `IS`: Subject exactly matches
- `IS_NOT`: Subject doesn't match
- `REGEX`: Subject matches regular expression
- `BEGINS_WITH`: Subject starts with text
- `ENDS_WITH`: Subject ends with text

### Step 4: Add Actions

1. Click **Add Action**
2. Select action type from the dropdown
3. Configure action value based on type:
   - **Group actions**: Select target group
   - **String actions**: Enter tag names
   - **Integer actions**: Enter numeric values
   - **Float actions**: Enter decimal values
   - **Boolean actions**: Check/uncheck box

### Step 5: Test and Enable

1. Use **Test Filter** to verify behavior
2. Enable the filter for production use
3. Monitor filter execution in logs

---

## Best Practices

### Filter Organization

1. **Use Clear Names**: Name filters descriptively (e.g., "Arnold Jobs - GPU Tags")
2. **Order Matters**: Place most specific filters first, general filters last
3. **Group Related Filters**: Keep similar filters together in the order list

### Performance Considerations

1. **Use STOP_PROCESSING**: Prevent unnecessary filter evaluations
2. **Optimize Regex**: Simple matchers are faster than complex regex
3. **Limit Active Filters**: Disable unused filters

### Resource Management

1. **Set Realistic Limits**: Don't over-allocate resources
2. **Use Layer-Specific Actions**: Target specific layer types
3. **Balance Min/Max Values**: Ensure max >= min for core/memory settings

### Testing

1. **Test on Dev Jobs**: Verify filters work before production use
2. **Monitor First Runs**: Watch filter execution logs
3. **Iterate**: Adjust matchers and actions based on results

## Troubleshooting Filters

### Filter Not Triggering

**Check:**
1. Filter is enabled
2. Matchers are correctly configured
3. Filter order allows it to execute
4. Previous filter didn't use STOP_PROCESSING

### Actions Not Applied

**Check:**
1. Action values are within valid ranges
2. Value types match action requirements
3. Groups exist for MOVE_JOB_TO_GROUP actions
4. Check Cuebot logs for error messages

### Conflicting Filters

**Issue:** Multiple filters modify the same property
**Solution:**
1. Review filter order
2. Use STOP_PROCESSING in earlier filters
3. Consolidate related filters
4. Make matchers more specific
