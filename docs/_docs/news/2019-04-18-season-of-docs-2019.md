# Season of Docs 2019

### OpenCue is applying to take part in Season of Docs 2019

#### April 18, 2019

---

The OpenCue project is aiming to grow our docs to support developers who are
integrating OpenCue with related Media infrastructure, such as asset management
or transcoding systems. This would include both proprietary systems, as well as
popular commercial project management tools, such as
[Shotgun](https://www.shotgunsoftware.com/) and
[Ftrack](https://www.ftrack.com/).

We're very interested in growing our developer docs more generally, so student
contributors can use the following ideas as a starting point or propose their
own ideas to grow our developer docs!

## Writing getting started guides for OpenCue plugin development

OpenCue maintains a set of plugins for various content creation apps that ease
the process of launching OpenCue jobs. These plugins make use of the OpenCue
Python API and [Qt (PySide2)](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/).

This set of plugins is currently quite small, and the OpenCue docs don't yet
provide a set of getting started guides for plugin development. When such a
doc set exists we can share it with our user base and enable third party users
and developers to contribute their own plugins.

Participating in this project could allow you to develop and demonstrate the
following skills:

*   Researching a developer's user journey
*   Planning a doc set
*   Drafting original developer guides
*   Working collaboratively with a development team through peer reviews
*   Publishing developer docs on an existing site

## Writing a developer tutorial for OpenCue integration

The OpenCue docs don't yet include dedicated guides to help developers learn
how to integrate OpenCue into existing Media infrastructure using the PyCue
API. A developer guide, such as a codelab or tutorial series could help
illustrate working with the OpenCue API using sample code.

Participating in this project could allow you to develop and demonstrate
the following skills:

*   Conducting developer requirements research
*   Planning technical training materials, including sample code
*   Drafting original developer content such as codelabs or tutorials
*   Working collaboratively with a development team through peer reviews
*   Publishing developer docs on an existing site
