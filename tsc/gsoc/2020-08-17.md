# Summer of Code Check-in Meeting August 17 2020

Attendees: Brian Cipriano, Greg Denton, Shiva Kannan

* Shiva: work update.
   * Responded to PR comments, expanded docstrings, added a few tests.
   * Exception handling added, ready for review.
   * Started widget tests, some of the testing logic makes more sense at the widget level.
   * Azure progress, able to fetch list of groups, existing API design works with only minor
     modification.
   * Moving on to creation and deletion next, will reach out to Greg for advice.
   * Azure API working well with our original assumptions, no major changes needed.
   * Scale set status is a bit unexpected, need to figure out details. Seems to show status as
     errored if any past operations failed, even if set is currently in a good state.
   * Working on threadpool for operation caching.
* Brian: let's keep Azure stuff out of the first PR for now, try to wrap it up soon.
* May need to limit Azure api by resourcegroup for isolation, similar to what we do for GCP project.
* Config system for e.g. GCP project ID, let's use environment vars for now. Need to work it into
  the existing config system later, will think through how this should work.
* Discussion of public IPs for scale sets. Need to pass a CLI flag when creating the template.
   * Problems with instances not starting correctly and scale set status showing as failure may be
     related to public IP as well.
