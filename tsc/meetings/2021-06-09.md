    * Auto-close Github issues
        * Proposal:
            * Any issues in a Project have been identified as important and will be ignored.
            * Other issues:
                * If no update for 60 days, will get the label "stale" and a comment notifying of
                  auto-close.
                * If no further update for 7 days, will be closed.
                * Any issue update will reset the timer â€” remove the "stale" tag
        * Action https://github.com/marketplace/actions/close-stale-issues will be used.
        * May need another action to label issues if they are in a project, the above action doesn't
          appear to have options for ignoring issues based on project membership.
* Other current work updates
    * Bug where services would need restart
        * cuebot -> rqd module, calls not getting responses
        * needed to set deadline on all grpc calls, fixed issue
        * cuebot threadpools able to self-heal now
    * Cache of RQD connections
        * need to tune cache size to about number of expected RQD hosts
    * Set concurrency cache settings
        * set to number of threads expected
    * Issue about RQD hardcoded timezone
