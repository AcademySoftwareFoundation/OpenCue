# Meeting Notes 16 Oct 2019

Secretary: Brian Cipriano

Attended: Matt Chambers, Brian Cipriano, Greg Denton, Benjamin Dines,
  Dave Fellows, Sean Looper, Erik Strauss, Gerald Tiu
  
-  Microsoft Threat Modeler, report from Dave
  -  Only runs on windows, so not a great immediate option
  -  There are a few other alpha-level tools out there that could be
     good options
  -  We are already pretty sure of what the key areas of focus should
     be:
     -  gRPC
     -  RQD arbitrary commands
     -  Db credentials
  -  Let's focus on those key areas first, there's plenty to start with
  -  Greg: let's start a github project to collect this stuff. There are
     some key dependencies to satisfy first: users system, logging
     (access logs)
  -  How to generate certs/keys for all rqd instances?
     -  Could switch to bidirectional channel served by Cuebot, as
        opposed to Cuebot+all RQD instances all serving their own gRPC
        servers. Then there's only one (or maybe a few) servers to
        worry about, greatly simplifies key generation/distribution.
-  Starting to outgrow github issues?
   -  Brian to investigate ASWF jira setup
-  Project leads howto
   -  No initial comments, will allow some more time to review then
      let's get the initial policy in place, can revise later if needed.
-  Graduation progress
   -  Minor discussion on adoption metrics
-  Christian's PR â€” any blockers?
   -  https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/pull/469 
-  Logging proposal, moving forward. Looks good to TSC initially.
-  Telemetry/metrics collection
   -  General agreement this would be good but no concrete next steps
      yet.
   -  Should query userbase about what they're using now and how we
      should publish metrics.
-  Microsoft asking about GCP project for initial tests.
   - They will send project ID to Brian, can add credits to cover
     testing costs.
