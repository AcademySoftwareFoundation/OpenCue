# OpenCue TSC Meeting Notes 20 July 2022

Secretary: Brian Cipriano

Agenda/Notes:

* Open Source Days
    * Sections
        * New stuff
            * Improved Windows support, including hybrid farms with multiple OSes (multiple log roots, path conversion
              in CueGUI)
            * Improved GPU support
            * New scheduler modes
            * Scitech investigations
        * Github stats
            * Last year 34 -> 41 unique contributors from 10+ organizations
            * Grown committer pool to 8 committers
            * 102 PRs merged = 2/week
            * Issues
                * Over past year, 27 unique people have submitted issues.
                * Would be nice to count people who have contributed to issues as well, many folks will chime in but not
                  necessarily open their own issues.
                    * Any way to do this?
            * Contributor pool significantly more diverse
                * In the past year 50% of commits came from "founding" organizations.
                * In past years / all time this was ~70%.
                * Good to highlight project is not dependent on the original creators.
        * SPI update
            * Fixing things from migration
            * Working on upstream merge issues
            * When was oracle removed? Apr 2021
            * Potential good story: migration cue3 -> opencue -> opencue master branch
            * Stats on shows that have used opencue
            * Anything usable from scitech presentation?
        * Q&A
            * Let's collect potential warmup questions
            * We could also maybe use the LF poll tool. For example to vote on feature requests.
        * Brian to create new doc to polish this outline.
    * Presenters
        * Diego: in-person, run through the project update then open up Q&A
        * Ben: virtual
        * Greg: in-person
        * Brian to email LF organizers with contact info.
* Record video on using opencue from wrangler perspective? From Noel? Let's check in after OSD event.
