    * Reviews needed.
        * Be careful we're not making CueSubmit too specialized, keep it generally useful for new
          users.
        * Let's invite the author to a TSC meeting soon.
    * Improvements are good, is there something else we can offer? What would be helpful for
      larger-studio users? Or is the Python library good enough?
        * Best to expand pyoutline examples / docs to help developers who have already tried
          CueSubmit.
        * Build on basic example used in integration test script.
* Blender plugin update
    * Currently testing job submission, blocked on some submission code.
    * Loading python deps (opencue, filesequence)
        * Can manually copy into blender plugin directory, but how to automate this?
        * Does Blender offer alternatives e.g. configuring plugin path via env var?
        * Look into creating additional packages, maybe as empty packages.
* Openshift Cuebot version
    * Putting multiple Cuebots behind gRPC load balancer, and pointing RQD at the LB. Currently to
      take a Cuebot offline all RQDs need to be restarted to move to a new Cuebot host, this solves
      that problem.
    * Would make a good tutorial or sample to include in the main repo.
    * Prometheus export needs to be reworked. Currently using a separate client to query metrics,
      which doesn't work with the LB setup as it will not redirect requests to a consistent Cuebot.
      Working on a change to send metrics directly from Cuebot.
