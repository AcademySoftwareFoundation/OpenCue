# OpenCue TSC Meeting Notes 27 Mar 2024

Secretary: Brian Cipriano

Agenda/Notes:

* TSC handoff
    * Brian has been TSC chair for 5-6 years. At this point his time is limited due to other work
      priorities. TSC and ASWF participation has been suffering as a result.
    * It's a good idea to rotate chairs regularly anyway for project health.
    * Will work offline to discuss among TSC members and find a new chair.
    * Brian will stay around to participate in the project, and will be heavily involved in the
      handoff to make sure the new chair is comfortable with new duties.
* New web UI version
    * Prototype coming in early may.
    * Still planned as readonly.
    * Authentication:
        * okta within SPI
        * By default it will need to use the database, need to create User as first-class object.
        * Login with X (google / github / etc.) in the future?
        * Brian: rolling our own auth system feels very old school. There must be a better way.
* New Nimby notifications on desktop
    * Disabled by default, new constant to enable.
    * Tkinter for showing notifications, so it's cross-platform.
* Java 21 upgrade
    * Ongoing, most tests complete, PR still being prepared.
