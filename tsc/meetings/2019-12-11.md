   - Agreement we need to do much more to make this type of setup easy to deploy
   - Set env vars at subscription level
   - Could use env vars directly in the command, or could use #TOKEN# functionality for commands
     and have RQD replace those with env var values. Let's start without it and can add later if
     needed
- 2to3 on proto files removes need for nasty sed hack — agreed to move forward with that
- Packaging
   - Need for better packaging / install procedures across the board
   - Create deb/rpm for Cuebot/RQD, can push to repos or simply publish as a release artifact
   - Should look into freezing the Python components too, creating installers
- Slack channel for dev conversations
   - Starting to use this now for quick back and forth
   - Invite-only but any members can invite anyone else, feel free to add whoever would like to join
- Canceling next meeting (Dec 25), next meeting Jan 8
- Reviewers
   - Greg transitioning, still involved in the project
   - Looking to add more reviewers / committers. Christian a good candidate
   - 2 approver rule coming soon, to help ease new reviewers into it
   - More work to do to increase test coverage to improve confidence in new changes
- Spark conference
   - No takers, not sure if worthwhile
