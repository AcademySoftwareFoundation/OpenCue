# OpenCue TSC Meeting Notes 12 Apr 2023

Secretary: Brian Cipriano

Agenda/Notes:

* Host ping time until marked as DOWN
    * https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/issues/1265
    * This does seem long, any reason why?
    * Diego: seems unusual. Should be less than a minute for host to be marked DOWN. CueGUI should
      update 15-20s
    * Should we make this a config setting?
    * SPI to check on their code for differences
    * Might need to lower default value, this is a good candidate for config flag.
* RQD config file overhaul
    * https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/pull/1270
    * Would be good to get SPI input on this.
    * Let's review in more detail. No immediate concerns. SPI has some similar configuration already
* Rez setup email thread
    * https://lists.aswf.io/g/opencue-dev/topic/97805737#571
    * Diego: might make a better tutorial doc than merging into master branch. We don't want to
      confuse new users with multiple packaging options.
    * Look into spk, an OSS project.
    * pip packages will make this setup much simpler.
* Prepending timestamps to RQD child process output
    * https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/pull/1286
    * Doesn't modify any existing output other than prepending timestamp to each line.
    * Linux-specific, configurable.
* Python 2 support
    * Not ready to drop support for 2 entirely, especially python libraries.
    * GUI should be fine to go 3-only.
    * If we're going to do it, document which tag contains the last 2 support
    * A py2 branch might be helpful if anyone wants to backport, but might have issues with our
      versioning tooling.
* Blender plugin update
    * Basic plugin is loading, currently navigating issues with installing pyoutline into Blender
      environment. Will start to send test jobs soon
    * Will continue to update email thread.
