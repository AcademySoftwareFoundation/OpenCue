   * Discussion on agenda. See doc for more details.
* Current work updates
   * Brian: Github Actions
      * Still troubleshooting S3 credentials with LF support.
   * Greg: events system
      * Refreshed memory on design. Recommended approach is to just use external messaging, not
        worth going back to embedded system. Can mitigate ease of setup by adding a new Docker with
        our preferred messaging service. What level of integration with the service should we go
        for?
      * Design doc using Kafka as an example, with option to extend to CSPs.
   * Diego: Windows, nimby lock working cross-platform. PR coming soon.
      * Windows ready for Beta tag? Diego: worked out many bugs, basic flow working, probably ready.
        Greg agrees.
* Add Diego as committer. Unanimously approved.
