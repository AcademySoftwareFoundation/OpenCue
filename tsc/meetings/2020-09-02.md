* User community survey
   * Starting to gather questions:
     https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j5V6Zj8T5x6SC0F34SnChy6vc1MVza5kej9fYGsgxsc/edit 
   * Notes from survey discussion in that doc.
* Diego: OpenCue on Windows updates
   * Windows bare metal machine with unreal installed
   * Connecting to cuebot on linux
   * pyoutline, cuegui running on windows clients
   * Using standard Shell job type. Might need custom windows job type
      * Why? Shell job creates single frame for the whole job as unreal doesn't have / not using
        start/end frame args. Other apps split it into many frames. Need to split to improve
        distribution, speed.
   * Any specific problems? RQD and outline setup.py install not compatible with egg files,
     couldn't access config files, auxiliary data. Installed everything using pip local install.
   * Any integration directly with unreal? Just shell scripts for now. Any interest in submission
     plugin? No requests from artists yet but will follow up.
   * Mostly using it to render at night, using artist workstations as render nodes, nimby locked.
* Current work updates
   * Brian
      * Github Actions complete
      * Conferences complete
      * Python packaging
         * pyinstaller looks good, any recommendations?
         * Looking at zip app, similar to egg files but more current, uses zip to package everything
         * RQD using rpm. Need to expand server-side stuff more, focused only on Python stuff at the
           moment.
   * Diego:
      * UI fixes incoming
      * Booking rules, removal of arnold-specific logic that SPI was using. Tweaking min/max cores
        doesn't recreate the same logic. If service was arnold it would bypass checks and book all
        available cores. Could add new max-cores checkbox to service page. Lower priority for now,
        can work around.
