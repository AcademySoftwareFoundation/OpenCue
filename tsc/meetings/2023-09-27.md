# OpenCue TSC Meeting Notes 27 Sep 2023

Secretary: Brian Cipriano

Agenda/Notes:

* OOM protection logic: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/pull/1317
    * Reworks OOM protection using percentages instead of hardcoded values, helps for larger hosts.
    * Draft status for now, working on some more testing.
    * Cuebot only for now. Solves 99% of cases but 1% still have a race condition because RQD does
      not send an exit code indicating OOM. RQD fixes coming next.
* Reserve all cores / negative cores: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/pull/1313
    * Diego / SPI to discuss.
    * Definitely needs to be wrapped in a flag.
* Nimby override: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/pull/1311
    * Let's double check the fallback behavior is working and there's not some other error.
    * PR could be a good idea anyway, we know pynput isn't installed in certain environments and the
      warning in the logs can be confusing.
* SPI update
    * Merging CueGUI updates. Config file change and qtpy change.
* Blender plugin
    * Running in a container working now.
    * Docker run flag to mount the host network worked. Let's update the linux contributing page.
    * Job submitted but didn't show up in the job list. RQD can't find blender command, debugging.
