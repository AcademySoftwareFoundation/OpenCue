  Sean Looper, Erik Strauss, Gerald Tiu

-  Security
   -  Needs some attention
   -  Current model assumes network is safe, this is not considered a good
      assumption these days
   -  We should switch to a zero-trust model where each component is isolated
      and confirms proper auth/permissions
   -  Cuebot should be the first area of focus, especially the GRPC connection
   -  User auth an important angle, as you can't do user verification without it
   -  Existing user management systems (e.g. Active Directory) will be important
      here
   -  Is multi tenancy an issue?
      -  We are multiple layers removed from any shared resources, this is an
         issue for CSPs to worry about
   -  No isolation between jobs binpacked into a single RQD instance though,
      something to think about. Currently handled by using different allocations
      but could be improved
   -  Microsoft Threat Modeler
      -  Let's check it out
      -  Dave to take an initial look
-  New docs
   -  [Alex] No update, github issue and other planning coming soon
-  Ready to publish SPI use case doc?
   -  Should be just about ready, will collect final approvals but let's go
      ahead and prep the public version in the meantime
   -  Does doc include deployment machine specs? Ben: yes, specs of each
      VM / db server
   -  Brian to circulate draft in TSC list
-  Any other current work?
-  Brian to check in with Matt offline
-  Tracking graduation requirements
   -  Progress on some items such as CI/CD, static analysis, good contribution
      base
   -  Adoption metric an interesting question
   -  Brian to start a list tracking progress towards graduation
-  Logging
   -  https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/issues/72
