# OpenCue TSC Meeting Notes 19 January 2022

Secretary: Brian Cipriano

Agenda/Notes:

* Completed 2022 Goals
    * Nothing yet.
* Ongoing work
    * CueGUI memory leak
        * https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/issues/1025
        * SPI: still researching and testing their fix.
    * Scheduling fixes
        * Thread pool properties
            * Two versions:
                * https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/pull/1008
                * SPI version https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/pull/1035
            * PRs need review.
            * Let's start with 1035, then merge 1008 to fix conflicts to see what in 1008 is still
              useful, if anything.
        * Schedule dispatch frame
            * https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/pull/1012
            * Adds database fields to eliminate multiple cuebots handing out the same frames.
            * Might not want to merge while larger scheduler redesign is going on.
    * RQD change, adding child proc info into log, storing in database
        * For understanding memory usage of complex jobs
        * Entering testing soon.
    * Replaced embedded Postgres server.
    * log4j update
        * Was blocked on embedded Postgres server, now good to resume.
        * Should post announcement to opencue-users before merging.
* 2022 Goals
    * New user UX
        * Publish PyPI packages
            * Design
              doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWjMNGzGmBvuHoBzXewQEzdwTKtrY6VOtaPi7ALwWg0/
            * Proposal for config file
              standardization: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWjMNGzGmBvuHoBzXewQEzdwTKtrY6VOtaPi7ALwWg0/edit#heading=h.v85uo9klwqft
            * Config cleanup for pycue done, tested on macOS and Windows, merged.
            * pyoutline, cuesubmit config cleanup review done, ready to merge.
            * CueGUI/RQD still to do.
        * Fix cuebot:latest tag for sandbox setup
            * Proposal: publish Docker images for every new patch version (i.e. every new commit to
              master)
            * Proposal accepted.
            * No progress implementing this yet.
            * Related: for PyPI design we may want to also publish packages for every new patch
              version.
    * Docs refresh
        * User guide refresh
            * Split into "install from latest release" and "install from master"
            * Needed to assist transition to publish Docker images on all commits
            * No progress.
        * API reference
            * We have the ability to generate HTML from any commit, but we need a new CI pipeline to
              build and publish this on opencue.io for new releases.
            * Proposal: for now, highlight existing docs for building reference locally
            * Proposal accepted.
            * Brian: cleaned up local build process, sent email with doc
              link: https://www.opencue.io/contributing/opencue/build-docs/
        * pyoutline examples

            * No progress.
        * Configuration guides for Python/Cuebot/RQD
            * In progress, will be done as part of PyPI work.
