# OpenCue TSC Meeting Notes 28 Sep 2022

Secretary: Brian Cipriano

Agenda/Notes:

* Update on M1 issues / CI failures
    * All issues now have proposed fixes. Working our way through review.
* Preparing for next release
    * qApp PR needs review/merge. This is the highest priority to unbreak our CI pipelines.
    * Logging flags. Dropping --log.frame-log-root is a breaking change. Continue supporting it for
      now? Add a deprecation warning?
        * Possible solution: https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/pull/1203
        * Could also just rename the new flags.
        * Will follow up on the PR.
    * Integration test script
        * Existing script is very basic and SPI specific. Won't really save us time vs writing from
          scratch.
        * CueGUI is the challenge here. Automating API calls is trivial, automating GUI tests much
          more involved.
        * Script to test our sandbox setup is a good place to start. This is critical for ensuring
          new users have a good experience.
        * "testing" show deactivated?
            * Reported in https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/issues/1205
            * Culprit PR: ​​https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue/pull/1151
                * Does automated show cleanup, testing show is not in the allowlist.
            * Quick fix: allowlist testing show in properties file.
            * Permanent fix: change 30 day hardcoded limit to come from properties files. -1 means
              feature is disabled. Disable this by default.
* Redis
    * No update yet, work to resume later.
