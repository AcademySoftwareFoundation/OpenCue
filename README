Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenCue is the render farm management software used at Imageworks. It allows users
to submit jobs to a configurable dispatch queue that allocates the necessary
computational resources. OpenCue has been in use at Imageworks since 2007.

Basic Queue Vocabulary:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queue - The renderfarm as used to actively process a large number of render
jobs using define priorities.

Cue - A nickname for the entire queuing system. The base name of the
SPI render queue tools. Thus "cuetopia3", "cuerun", "cueman3", etc.

Cores - The processing units that make up a render machine. A machine
known as a "dub" contains 8 cpu cores.

Procs - Old terminology from cue2 where it use to refer to a single
core of a machine. Typically a proc refers to a running frame.

Job - Any script sent to the queue to be processed on remote cores.

Layers - The sub-jobs in an outline script job.

Frames - An individual command contained in a layer.

Dependent Job - a job which will not run until the frames of
another job are completed.

Soft Dependency - when all the frames of the first job need to
finish for the second job to begin.

Hard Dependency - a frame to frame dependency (only the corresponding
frames need to finish).

cuetopia - A graphical user interface to monitor and interact with
Jobs, Layers and Frames.

Outline Script - A powerful tool for submitting jobs to the queue. Outline
scripts can batch what would be multiple job submissions into a single job,
setting up dependencies and/or running in parallel. Outline scripts can
submit almost any type of job to the cue - maya, katana, even shell commands.

pycuerun - The command used to submit outline scripts to the queue.
booked - When machine resources are assigned to a job causing a
frame to start running.

This project is missing some components that we couldn't open source and is not
yet expected to build. But stay tuned for more information and development.
