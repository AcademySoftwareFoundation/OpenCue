# Security and OpenCue

The OpenCue Technical Steering Committee (TSC) takes security very
seriously. We strive to design secure software, and utilize continuous 
integration and code analysis tools to help identify potential 
vulnerabilities.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Quickly resolving security related issues is a priority. If you think
you've found a potential vulnerability in OpenCue, please report it by
emailing <opencue-tsc-private@lists.aswf.io>. Only TSC members and ASWF
project management have access to these messages.

Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue, and any other information that
could aid an investigation. Someone will assess the report and make every
effort to respond within 14 days.
