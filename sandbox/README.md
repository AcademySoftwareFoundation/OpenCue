# OpenCue sandbox environment

The sandbox environment provides a way to run a test OpenCue deployment. You can use the sandbox
environment to run small tests or development work. The sandbox environment runs OpenCue components
in separate Docker containers on your local machine.

To learn how to run the sandbox environment, see

monitoring for key services.
