# OpenCue sandbox environment

The sandbox environment provides a way to run a test OpenCue deployment. You
can use the sandbox environment to run small tests or development work. The sandbox
environment runs OpenCue components in separate Docker containers on your local
machine.

To learn how to run the sandbox environment, see
