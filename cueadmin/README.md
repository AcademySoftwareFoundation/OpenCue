# CueAdmin

CueAdmin is a command-line administration tool for OpenCue that provides full control over jobs, layers, frames, and hosts. It allows administrators to perform advanced management tasks such as setting priorities, killing jobs, or managing resource allocation. It's written in Python and provides a thin layer over the OpenCue Python API.

## Installation

Install CueAdmin with:

```bash
pip install opencue-cueadmin
```

For development:

```bash
# Clone repository and install with test dependencies
git clone https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenCue.git
cd OpenCue/cueadmin
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

Basic CueAdmin commands:

```bash
# List jobs
cueadmin -lj

# List hosts
cueadmin -lh

# Kill a job
cueadmin -kill-job JOB_NAME

# Set job priority
cueadmin -priority JOB_NAME 100
```

For full documentation, see the [OpenCue Documentation](https://opencue.io/docs/).

## Running Tests

CueAdmin includes a comprehensive test suite covering allocation management, output formatting, and core functionality.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install with test dependencies
pip install -e ".[test]"

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=cueadmin --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Test Infrastructure

**Test Dependencies:**
- `pytest>=8.0.0` - Modern test framework
- `pytest-cov>=4.0.0` - Coverage reporting
- `pytest-mock>=3.10.0` - Enhanced mocking
- `mock>=4.0.0` - Core mocking library
- `pyfakefs>=5.2.3` - Filesystem mocking

**Test Types:**
- **Unit tests** - Function-level testing (`tests/test_*.py`)
- **Integration tests** - Command workflow testing
- **Allocation tests** - Allocation management functionality (`tests/test_allocation_commands.py`)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Basic test run
pytest tests/

# Verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_allocation_commands.py

# Run with coverage and HTML report
pytest --cov=cueadmin --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Use the convenience script
./run_tests.sh --coverage --html
```

### Coverage Reporting

```bash
# Terminal coverage report
pytest --cov=cueadmin --cov-report=term-missing

# HTML coverage report (generates htmlcov/ directory)
pytest --cov=cueadmin --cov-report=html

# XML coverage for CI/CD
pytest --cov=cueadmin --cov-report=xml
```

### Development Testing

**For contributors:**

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run all tests with linting
pytest && pylint cueadmin tests

# Run tests across Python versions (requires tox)
tox

# Format code
black cueadmin tests
isort cueadmin tests
```

**CI/CD Integration:**

```bash
# In OpenCue root directory
./ci/run_python_tests.sh     # Includes cueadmin tests
./ci/run_python_lint.sh      # Includes cueadmin linting

# Run cueadmin tests specifically
cd cueadmin && python -m pytest tests/
```

### Test Configuration

Tests are configured via `pyproject.toml`:
- **pytest.ini_options** - Test discovery and execution
- **coverage settings** - Coverage reporting configuration
- **markers** - Test categorization (unit, integration, slow)

### Continuous Integration

The test suite is integrated into:
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated testing on PRs
- **Docker builds** - Container-based testing
- **Lint pipeline** - Code quality checks
