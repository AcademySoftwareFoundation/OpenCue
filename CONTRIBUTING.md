# Contributing to OpenCue

So, you want to contribute to OpenCue? To find out how you can help, refer to OpenCue's
[contribution guidelines](https://www.opencue.io/contributing/opencue/contributing/).

## Guideline for new issues
GitHub issues are a great place to start a conversation! Issues aren’t restricted to bugs; we happily welcome feature requests and other suggestions submitted as issues. 

The only conversations we would direct away from issues are questions in the form of “How do I do X”. Please direct these to the opencue [slack channel](https://academysoftwarefdn.slack.com/archives/CMFPXV39Q), and consider contributing what you’ve learned to our docs if appropriate! 

Please categorize your issues accordingly and make sure all sections on template are filled up.
