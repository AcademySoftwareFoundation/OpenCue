# Building Python APIs reference docs

This directory hosts configuration and scaffolding for building
the OpenCue Python APIs reference docs using Sphinx. The
project is working on publishing the generated API reference
docs on [www.opencue.io](https://www.opencue.io), but in the
meantime you can build the reference HTML locally. This guide is
also useful if you want to build the HTML reference during
development.

To learn how to set up your development environment to build the
HTML reference docs for some of the Python packages and
modules in OpenCue, see
[Building the OpenCue Python APIs reference docs](https://www.opencue.io/contributing/opencue/build-docs/).

To view the main OpenCue docs, visit the
[project website](https://www.opencue.io/docs). To view the source
code for the main OpenCue docs, visit the project's
[website repository](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/opencue.io).
