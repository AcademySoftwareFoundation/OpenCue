/// Data Access Object for proc (virtual processor) operations in the job dispatch system.
///
/// A proc represents the allocation of compute resources (CPU cores, memory, GPUs) from a host
/// to execute a specific frame. This DAO manages the lifecycle of proc records in the database,
/// tracking which resources are reserved for which frames.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// The `ProcDao` is responsible for:
/// - Creating new proc records when frames are dispatched to hosts
/// - Recording resource reservations (cores, memory, GPUs) for frame execution
/// - Maintaining the relationship between hosts, jobs, layers, frames, and allocated resources
///
/// # Database Schema
///
/// The proc table tracks:
/// - Resource identifiers (host, show, layer, job, frame)
/// - Reserved compute resources (cores, memory, GPUs)
/// - Pre-reserved and used memory tracking
/// - Local vs. remote dispatch flag
pub struct ProcDao {
    /// Shared connection pool for database operations.
    #[allow(dead_code)]
    connection_pool: Arc<Pool<Postgres>>,
}

/// SQL query to insert a new proc record into the database.
///
/// Creates a proc entry that tracks resource allocation for a frame execution.
/// The query inserts all resource reservation details including CPU cores, memory,
/// GPUs, and the relationships to host, show, layer, job, and frame.
///
/// # Parameters (Positional)
///
/// 1. `pk_proc` - Unique proc identifier (UUID)
/// 2. `pk_host` - Host ID where the proc is allocated
/// 3. `pk_show` - Show ID that owns this proc
/// 4. `pk_layer` - Layer ID within the job
/// 5. `pk_job` - Job ID that this proc belongs to
/// 6. `pk_frame` - Frame ID being executed by this proc
/// 7. `int_cores_reserved` - Number of CPU cores reserved (as hundredths)
/// 8. `int_mem_reserved` - Amount of memory reserved (bytes)
/// 9. `int_mem_pre_reserved` - Pre-reserved memory amount (bytes)
/// 10. `int_mem_used` - Initial memory usage (bytes)
/// 11. `int_gpus_reserved` - Number of GPUs reserved
/// 12. `int_gpu_mem_reserved` - GPU memory reserved (bytes)
/// 13. `int_gpu_mem_pre_reserved` - Pre-reserved GPU memory (bytes)
/// 14. `int_gpu_mem_used` - Initial GPU memory usage (bytes)
/// 15. `b_local` - Whether this is a local dispatch (boolean)
