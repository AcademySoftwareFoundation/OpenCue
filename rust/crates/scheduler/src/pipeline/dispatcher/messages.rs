/// on the specified host. The dispatcher will:
/// - Lock the host to prevent concurrent dispatches
/// - Book frames one by one until host resources are exhausted
/// - Update frame states in the database
/// - Communicate with RQD via gRPC to launch frames
/// - Return the updated host and layer state
///
/// # Fields
///
/// * `layer` - Layer containing frames to dispatch
/// * `host` - Target host with available resources
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `Ok(DispatchResult)` - Successfully dispatched frames with updated state
/// * `Err(DispatchError)` - Dispatch failed due to various errors
